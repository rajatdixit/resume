			Worked with the client and a team of 5 on a Smart BLE Switch. 
			Analysed the competetive landscape, did the technological assesment and set the product roadmap.  
			Designed basic skeleton iOS app layout for simple on/off and slider light dimming communications. 
			Lead Electrical and PCB designer for state of the art flexible PCBâ€™s that housed all the electronics.
			Design models were simulated in MatLab and verified using SolidWorks and Altium.

			<i class="fa fa-cogs"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">3 Axis Robotic Arm </a></strong><br>
			Worked with a team of 3 on a 3 DOF (Degree of Freedom) Axis Robotic Arm.
			Designed and built the high power electronics that powered the arm's three 2A motors. 
			PCB designer, proper industry standard techniques were followed. 
			Good heatsinking techniques were used to keep the circuit at good operating temperature.  
			Design models were simulated in MatLab and verified using SolidWorks and Altium.

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">FPGA VCR Controller</a></strong><br>
			Used Altera FPGA board to simulate and program a VCR controller in VHDL (Verilog Hardware Description Language). 
			Used embedded C and RTL analysis to code the logic in Quartus. 
			As a project bonus, integrated an LCD display driver to show visual interaction when the VCR is 
			playing/paused/recording etc.

			<i class="fa fa-cogs"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Automatic Capacitive Soda Dispenser</a></strong><br>
			Worked with a team of 5 to design, develop and program an automatic soda dispenser.
			Designed and built a circuit that measured the capacitance of a cup and the temperature of the soda in it. 
			Programmed a servo to automatically close and open a valve to allow the soda to flow 
			according to the capactiance of S/M/L cup. 
			Circuit was built on an Altera FPGA board using a 8052 soft-core processor. 
			All schematics were verified using SolidWorks and Altium.
