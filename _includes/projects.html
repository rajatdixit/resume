			<i class="fa fa-ship"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://ubcsailbot.org/team-roster/">UBC Sailbot - Electrical</a></strong>
			Worked on building an autonomous boat that sailed across the Atlantic Ocean. My job was to test, research and program
			different types of electrical devices. Worked on VHF antennas for boat-to-boat communication. Wrote and tested
			microcontroller code in C for the Torxis i00600 high torque servo rudder steering of the boat. Wrote drivers for
			the software team to be further used by them for on board software algorithms.
			Represented UBC Sailbot at the Unmanned Systems Canada Conference and the International Robotic Sailing Regatta.  	
			Industry project management tools like Slack, Asana and Trello were used for task management. 
			Electrical design models were verified using SolidWorks and Altium.
